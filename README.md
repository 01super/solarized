Installation
------------

1.  Copy `Solarized Dark.xml` and `Solarized Light.xml` to your IntelliJ IDEA preferences
color directory.  
On Mac OS X this is typically located in `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea10/colors` or `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea10CE/colors` (for the Community Edition).  
On Windows it is in `Documents and Settings/<user>/.IntelliJIdea10/config/colors`.
        
2. Restart IntelliJ IDEA

3. Go to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts` and select one of the new 
color themes.

Note About Fonts
-----------------
Unfortunately, font settings are included in the color settings files.
You should probably modify these in `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts | Font`
after adding the color schemes to your IntelliJ IDEA installation.
